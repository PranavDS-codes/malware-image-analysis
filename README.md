## Introduction
Malware detection is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity. In this project, we explore a novel approach to malware classification by representing malware samples as images and training deep learning models to classify them. The project is divided into two phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the dataset and model development.

## Phases of the Project

### Phase 1: Dataset Preparation and Initial Model Training

The first phase of our project focuses on gathering, combining, and processing existing datasets of malware images. This foundational step ensures we have a comprehensive and varied dataset that represents a wide spectrum of malware signatures. Following dataset preparation, we embark on training and testing multiple models. This iterative process allows us to establish baseline performance metrics and identify the most promising models for further refinement and optimization.

#### Steps in Phase 1
1. **Dataset Preparation**: We consolidated various publicly available malware image datasets to ensure a broad and balanced representation of different malware types. The datasets were processed, cleaned, and formatted for use in deep learning models.

2. **Model Training and Testing**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate multiple deep learning models, including:
   - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
   - **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
   - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
   - **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**
   - **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
   - **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**

3. **Evaluation**: Each model was trained and evaluated based on classification metrics, such as accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score. This helped in gauging the amount of research done till now and setting a baseline for further improvements.

#### Goal of Phase 1
The primary goal of Phase 1 was to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different models when applied to the malware image dataset. This groundwork provided insights into the capabilities of various models and established a clear path for optimization and future research in Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Optimization and Benchmarking
The second phase focuses on optimizing the malware-to-image conversion code and benchmarking its performance. This phase aims to refine the data preparation process to create higher-quality images that can enhance model accuracy and generalization.
